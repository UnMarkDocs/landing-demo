# How it Works

You provide the Markdown, we provide the hosting, styles, scripts... everything.
We even provide custom components!
Have a look at the example below to know more.

## Example

``` javascript
var demo = "This would show highlighted Javascript code with a copy button,";
var demo = demo + " like the one you're seeing :)";
```

!!! info
# Alert title
This would show an alert in a charming blue color, to let you know everything is OK.
